# houseofgigs-softeng-test

Hello there! Here are some instructions for House of gigs Software Engineer test.

## Task description

The task goal is to build a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) product catalog. We expect to see several screens in your catalog:

1. the *Home* screen, listing all the products
2. the *Product detail* screen, giving details about a single product, and listing the reviews of the product
3.*Bonus*: the *Write a review* screen, that allows a user to write a review

## Guidelines

1. To simplify your setup, you can use this [Snack on Expo](https://snack.expo.io/@mvdb/houseofgigs-softeng-test) and copy it (basically just hit the "Save changes" button and it will save your own version)
2. You will see a `data.json` file containing the objects for the product catalog: *Products* and *Reviews*
3. In the `utils` folder, you'll find the `apiClient` object that exposes 2 methods to retrieve *Products* and *Reviews*
4. Finally, you can create your components in the `components` folder and import them in the `App.js` file.
5. *Alternatively*, if you are not comfortable with using Expo, you can download the app code by clicking on "Export" and commit your changes to GitHub.

## Evaluation

We will evaluate your work by taking a closer look at the following:

- Working demo
- Guidelines followed
- Necessary features: liberty is given to the developer to define them


Good luck üçÄüí™üöÄ
